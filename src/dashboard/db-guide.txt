This is how you can properly setup the dashboard.

1- Head to https://discord.com/developers/applications/ and select your application.

2- Go to the auth page and copy the client ID and client secret and paste them in the config.json file

3- Select the domain, default is http://localhost:5000

4- In the auth page, scroll to "Redirects" and add:

- YOUR_DOMAIN/callback  (EXAMPLE http://localhost:5000/callback)
- YOUR_DOMAIN/api/invite (EXAMPLE http://localhost:5000/api/invite)

EXTRA:

- CONTACT US page
go to /src/dashboard/index.js LINE 709 and fill the webhook contact forms will be sent to.

Everything should work fine like that, any questions open a ticket :)
